# PreventTrapdoors
A quick plugin that prevents trapdoors for Spigot Server 1.19.4+


## Permissions

To bypass the trapdoor prevention, use `pt.bypass` 

## Setup

Just add the plugin to a 1.19.4 server and startup. 
WorldGaurd is a dependency! 

Regions should now have a flag that says "prevent-trapdoors" 
Setting this to allow will prevent players from messing with trapdoors in that region unless they have the bypass perm. 
Its a little weird, but I wrote this in like, 20 minutes.
